First practice of an creating a web application using Springboot

This website will check if a website is "up" (able to connect to servers) or "down" (unable to connect to servers or invalid web address provided)

Developed in Visual Studio Code, to run:
Open in VSCode and hit run in the DemoApplication class
Navigate to localhost:8080/check?url=https://www.google.com (replace https://www.google.com with any website youd like to check)
If the service is able to connect to the desired website, then the page will display "Site is up!". Otherwise, it will display "Site is down!".

Thanks!
